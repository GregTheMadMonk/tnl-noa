/**
 * \brief ArrayView serves for accessing array of data allocated by TNL::Array or
 * another way. It makes no data deallocation at the end of its life cycle. Compared
 * to TNL Array, it is lighter data structure and therefore it is more efficient
 * especially when it is being passed on GPU. The ArrayView can also be created
 * in CUDA kernels which is not the case of Array.
 *
 * \tparam Value is type of array elements.
 * \tparam Device is device where the array is going to be allocated - some of \ref Devices::Host and \ref Devices::Cuda.
 * \tparam Index is indexing type.
 *
 * In the \e Device type, the Array remembers where the memory is allocated.
 * This ensures the compile-time checks of correct pointers manipulation.
 * Methods defined as \ref __cuda_callable__ can be called even from kernels
 * running on device. Array elements can be changed either using the \ref operator[]
 * which is more efficient but it can be called from CPU only for arrays
 * allocated on host (CPU). If the array is allocated on GPU, the operator[]
 * can be called only from kernels running on the device (GPU). On the other
 * hand, methods \ref setElement and \ref getElement, can be called only from the
 * host (CPU) does not matter if the array resides on the host or the device.
 * In the latter case, explicit data transfer between host and device (via PCI
 * express or NVlink in more lucky systems) is invoked and so it can be very
 * slow. In not time critical parts of code, this is not an issue, however.
 * Another way to change data being accessed by the ArrayView is \ref evaluate which evaluates
 * given lambda function. This is performed at the same place where the array is
 * allocated i.e. it is efficient even on GPU. For simple checking of the array
 * contents, one may use methods \ref containValue and \ref containsValue and
 * \ref containsOnlyValue.
 *
 * \par Example
 * \include ArrayViewExample.cpp
 *
 * See also \ref Containers::Arrav, \ref Containers::Vector, \ref Containers::VectorView,
 * Containers::StaticArray, Containers::StaticVector.
